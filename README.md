# Mechassault Mod Pack

This mod pack is a compilation of several different mods for the first Mechassault game, aimed at improving the overall playing experience. Adding a huge number of new maps across all game modes, various new mech variants, and a carefully tuned multiplayer, just to name a few new additions. Please note that this does not completely replace the original version of the game. Once installed, you'll have an in-game option to toggle the mods on or off at will. To install and play, it is recommended to download the [latest release](https://github.com/EliteHeroes/Mechassault-Mod-Pack/releases) and follow the install guide.

## Install Guide

### Pre-requisites

* Need to acquire a copy of Mechassault. Either installed on a modded Xbox or on a PC. If you have an ISO-type file, make sure to convert it so you can directly access the contents of the game files.
* You'll also need to download and install all of [Mechassault's DLC](https://digiex.net/threads/xbox-offline-xbox-live-downloadable-content-dlc-installers.675) for the best and complete experience.

### Installing

1. Download the latest version of the Mod Pack from the '[Releases](https://github.com/EliteHeroes/Mechassault-Mod-Pack/releases)' page and extract the contents from 'Mechassault Mod Pack.zip'.
2. Open your Mechassault game folder. For console, you can do this using an FTP program to connect a modded Xbox to a PC.
3. Drag and drop all the original files inside the 'Mod Pack' folder into the Mechassault game folder, agreeing to replace the files.
4. If necessary, you can now convert the game files to an XISO format so emulators such as [Xemu](https://xemu.app) can read the new game data.
5. And that's it! You'll now be able to select 'LAUNCH MODS' in the options menu of the game, or you can start the modded game directly with the new N1Launch.xbe

### Help

If the game isn't detecting the newly installed mods, here are some things you can try:

* Make sure the files you placed inside the Mechassault game folder is in the correct place. The new files need to be directly along side the other game files. You'll receive a prompt to replace existing files if you've done this right. For example, you should be able to see a new folder called 'MGFs' next to 'Movie' inside the game folder.
* If you're missing maps or mechs on the multiplayer select screen, you might not have installed all the DLC correctly. Start the DLC installer and check the list to verify all the options have been selected and installed.
* If the game crashes or refusues to load certain maps or campaign missions, either your game files are corrupted or your copy of Mechssault is incomplete.
